## Get Started

### Requirements

Please ensure your operating system has the following software installed:

* [Git][] - see [GitHub's tutorial][github-git] for installation

* [Node.js][node] (v8.3+) - use [nvm][] to install it on any OS

  * After installing `nvm` you will need to run `nvm install node`
  * We also recommend you install [yarn][], which is an alternative to [npm][]

### Usage

#### Development

> The `start` script will start the server

[npm][]:

```sh
npm start
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn start
```

##### Debugging

> As similar to running any other [node][] process, simply use the environment variable `DEBUG`:

[npm][]:

```sh
DEBUG=* npm start
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
DEBUG=* yarn start
```

You can also use `NODE_DEBUG` if desired to debug [node][] internal modules.

#### Tests

> We use [ava][] and [supertest][] for testing

[npm][]:

```sh
npm test
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn test
```
